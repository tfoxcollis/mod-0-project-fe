## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
  `I tend to wait to ask questions- especially in zoom class.  I like to struggle productively for a little while before I reach out.  I do notice though that if I have a question during class I miss things because I'm trying to figure out the answer on my own.`

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
  * String - which is a sentence that can contain any value.
  * Boolean - which is a true/false or yes/no value.
  * Number - which is a number.  It can be a whole number, negative number or floating point (decimal).

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

  `console.log("Hello World!")`

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

  ` // Any text after double forward slashes is a comment.  These are used to help explain code and leave comments for other developers to give an explanation of your work if its needed.`

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
  `A variable is like a box that you give a name and it holds different items.`

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
  `Signing into my email a would have variables like email and password.  Once signed in there is probably a variable like user that uses my name to welcome me to my homepage.`

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
  `Concatenation is the math of strings.  It adds little baby strings together.`

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
  `The welcome message on my email could use concatenation (or interpolation) to add my name to a string.`

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
  `I understand that concatenation and interpolation are similar, I dont understand why I would want to use concatenation over interpolation?  Interpolation is so much easier to read and write. `
