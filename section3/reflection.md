## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?
`It felt good.  I liked the feeling of finding the answers on my own.`

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
`Developers would probably use arrays for things like play lists, friends lists, recipe ingredients, and comments section.`

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
`An Array method is a method that alters an array.`

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
`A loop is a function that can iterate through each item of an array and can be used to repeat something a set number of times.  You can use a loop to change a value of a variable or even without a variable you can console.log something different every time you go through the loop. `

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
`A loop is like the song 5 little monkeys jumping on the bed.  Each time it repeats the number is decreased by 1 until there are no more monkeys jumping on the bed.`

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
`For arrays, when would you use a for loop instead of forEach or map?`
