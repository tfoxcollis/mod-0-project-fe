## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
  * Mistakes are going to happen and is part of the learning process.
  * Asking for help and seeking out answers is part of a growth mindset.  In my previous profession, asking questions was sometimes looked down on and interpreted like you did not know what you were doing.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
  `Without realizing it, I practice SMART goals. I often break things down into specific, measurable, and achievable goals.  If I try to do too much at once it can be overwhelming. I have a hard time accepting that mistakes happen.  I am my worse critic. `

3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
  `I honestly did not notice the lack of support or direction. As I was completing section 2, I felt I remembered a lot more than I thought I did.  It gave me confidence when I was given a task without explanation and was able to execute it.`

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
  * A conditional statement is an if/else if/else statement.
  * An example of a conditional statement in daily life would be if I wake up tired I have coffee otherwise its water.
  * If I'm logged into a an application it allows me to see my profile if not than it asks me to log in.

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
  `To add multiple conditions to an if statement we use logical operators and/or. With an or operator one or the other condition must be true to continue.  With an and operator both conditions must be true to continue otherwise its false and stops.`

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
  `The two tools I can think of to use would be console.log and node/chrome dev tools to check.`

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
  * I am little confused about what you're asking in question 6 above.
  * How many logical operators can I use in a conditional statement?
